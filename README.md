# Quiz-App-using-Spring-Boot
Quiz App  is a Spring Boot Quiz application that allows users to create and publish quizzes. This application is being developed as a Spring Boot learning project, in which weâ€™ll be diving into several components of the Spring family.
This project was a part of my Spring boot practice that has taught me about Mysql, Spring Data Jpa, in memory H2 Database, Spring MVC,and various annotation.

# Note
# This is just a implementation of Spring boot .....A proper UI is yet to be developed ðŸ˜‚ðŸ¤£


# Working on react to give a proper user interface to the Quiz App
